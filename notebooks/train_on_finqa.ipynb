non-u.s .\\ndollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts .\\nthe terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months .\\ncurrently , our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro , primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses .\\nrelative to foreign currency exposures existing at october 31 , 2009 and november 1 , 2008 , a 10% ( 10 % ) unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows because we hedge a high proportion of our year-end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates .\\nthe market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rate or interest rate movements that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions , assets and liabilities being hedged .\\nthe counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings .\\nwe do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by these counterparties because we continually monitor the credit ratings of such counterparties .\\nwhile the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions , they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk .\\nthe amounts potentially subject to credit risk ( arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts ) are generally limited to the amounts , if any , by which the counterparties 2019 obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties .\\nthe following table illustrates the effect that a 10% ( 10 % ) unfavorable or
